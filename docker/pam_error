Hi guys, i'm using test servers (on my local machine). I can't SSH login to my centos server using normal users. I always get `Connection closed by <centosIP> port 22`. Create new user but same issue. No problem SSH login as root. I tried SSH from an ubuntu server to centos server and no problem with root. But same issue with normal user with error: `Connection to <centosIP> closed.`


`debug3: send packet: type 50`
`debug2: we sent a password packet, wait for reply`
`debug3: receive packet: type 53`
`debug3: input_userauth_banner`
`Connection closed by <centosIP> port 22`


error: Could not load host key: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
Failed password for testuser1 from <centosIP> port 41428 ssh2
fatal: Access denied for user testuser1 by PAM account configuration [preauth]
error: Could not load host key: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
Accepted password for root from <centosIP> port 41440 ssh2

using `LogLevel Debug3` in my sshd_config, this is what I got when logging in using testuser1: https://paste.centos.org/view/c4d85fb7
